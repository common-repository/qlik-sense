### How to Use ###

The plugin utilizes a WordPress shortcode to insert Qlik Sense objects into a post or page. There are currently 3 shortcodes available to insert Qlik Sense objects, a clear selections button or the Qlik Sense selections toolbar. The shortcodes can be added manually as detailed below or alternatively, the shortcodes can be generated and inserted using the buttons provided within the WordPress text or visual post/page editor. In the text editor, place the cursor in the post/page where you wish to insert the object, then click the relevant Qlik Sense button on the editor menu. You You may be prompted to enter required parameters for the shortcode. Once complete, the shortcode will be added to the post or page.

#### Qlik Sense Object ###

This shortcode allows you to embed a chart, table or other Qlik Sense object. The shortcode syntax is as follows:
```
[qlik-sense-object id="page1-obj2" qvid="nvqpV" height="400"]
```
Parameters are as follows:
* id="": is the unique div id. This is needed especially when you want to display the same object in 2 different instances
* qvid="": Is the object id as found in the "dev-hub/single-configurator" or the Qlik Explorer for Developers
* height="": The height of the visualization in pixels.
* nointeraction="true" (optional): Add this if you want to disable interactions. If you want the objects to have interaction, you can just omit this.
* app2="true" (optional): Add this to get the objects from the app defined as app 2 in the plugin settings.
* appid="" (optional): The variable qs_appid is added to store the value from the custom field appid. The custom field is used to be able to use a separate app for each page rather than the apps defined in the plugin config.
 
#### Qlik Sense Clear Selections Button ####

This shortcode allows you to embed a Clear Selections button.
```
[qlik-sense-object-clear-selections title="Clear Selections"]
```
Parameters are as follows:
* title="": Defines the text to be displayed on the button

#### Qlik Sense Selections Toolbar ####

This shortcode allows you to add the Qlik Sense selections toolbar to the post or page.
```
[qlik-sense-selection-toolbar]
```
No parameters are possible.

### The Result ###

If you save and view the page, it should look something like this. Notice that in the page with app 1 objects I have included an object from app2 and they both display when all pages are loaded on the same screen

![Qlik Sense - App 2](/assets/Helloworld.png?raw=true "Qlik Sense - App 2")
![Qlik Sense - App 1](/assets/Helloworld2.png?raw=true "Qlik Sense - App 1")
![Selection Toolbar](/assets/selection-toolbar.png?raw=true "Selection Toolbar")

### Frequently Asked ###

##### Cannot access the page

- For those that are upgrading to 1.1.7, make sure you set the settings page again with the port and if its over https
- Make sure you or a Qlik Sys Admin whitelists the site's url in your Virtual Proxy
- If the virtual proxy is "yianni" make sure you add in the settings "/yianni/"
- There are known issues with wp's cache plugins.
